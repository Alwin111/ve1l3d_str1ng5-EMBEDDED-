In this challange a hardware was given and it was connected to my lap
using arduino.After setting up the device when we click any characters 
if it was on the flag it showed the position where that letter or digit is
be placed and we have to repeatedly click the characters again and again 
to check if there is any letters repetting and finally we get all the letter and digits 
in the flag
